# Golden - Landing Page

`golden-landing` page is an implementation of the template in .psd using HTML, CSS/SASS and Task Runner technologies. The site is fully responsive and includes simple animations and effects.

The page was created for the purpose of learning Git in the Bootcamp Fullstack Developer course by Kodilla company.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Just clone the repository and open index.html in your browser.

```
git clone git@github.com:jerzy-jarczynski/golden-landing.git
```

### For developers

There is a package.json file in the repository containing task-runner. Dependencies can be installed in the standard way using npm:

```
npm install
```

Then you can run task watch on localhost:3000 with automatic refreshing of changes in the browser and conversion of SASS to CSS.

```
npm run watch
```

NOTE: There are differences in size of layout while running just index.html and localhost:3000. At the moment I don't know how to fix this.

## Release

To place the project on the server, copy directories and files from the list:
- `index.html`
- `css` directory with content
- `images` directory with content
- `vendor` directory with content

## Used technologies

`HTML`, `CSS/SASS`, `RWD`, `Bootstrap Grid`

I've used no JavaScript in this project. The fun element is pure CSS hamburger (but without animation on click, no active class).
